- **EmployeeLookupService.cs** - Service implementation with the following methods:
  - `GetAllAsync()` - Get all employee lookup records
  - `GetByPersonnelNumberAsync(string)` - Get employee by personnel number
  - `SearchAsync(string)` - Search by first name, last name, known name, or personnel number

  - `GetByEELevelAsync(string)` - Get employees by Employment Equity level
  - `GetByEECategoryAsync(string)` - Get employees by Employment Equity category
  - `GetWithDisabilityAsync(bool)` - Get employees by disability status

### 4. Controller

- **EmployeeLookupController.cs** - REST API controller with the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/employeelookup` - Get all employee lookup records
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/{personnelNumber}` - Get employee by personnel number
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/search/{searchTerm}` - Search employees
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/race/{race}` - Get employees by race
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/gender/{gender}` - Get employees by gender
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/ee-level/{eeLevel}` - Get employees by EE level
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/ee-category/{eeCategory}` - Get employees by EE category
  - `GET /api/employeelookup/disability/{hasDisability}` - Get employees by disability status
  - `POST /api/employeelookup` - Create new employee lookup record
  - `PUT /api/employeelookup/{personnelNumber}` - Update employee lookup record
  - `DELETE /api/employeelookup/{personnelNumber}` - Delete employee lookup record

### 5. Database

- **DbContext** - Updated `TrainingDevelopmentDbContext.cs` to include EmployeeLookup DbSet and entity configuration
- **Migration** - Created EF Core migration (`AddEmployeeLookupEntity`) to create the EmployeeLookups table with proper indexes

### 6. Dependency Injection

- **Program.cs** - Updated to register `IEmployeeLookupService` with DI container

### 7. Testing

- **EmployeeLookup.http** - HTTP requests file for testing all endpoints

## Database Schema

The EmployeeLookups table was created with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [EmployeeLookups] (
    [PersonnelNumber] nvarchar(20) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    [FirstName] nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,
    [KnownName] nvarchar(50) NULL,
    [Initials] nvarchar(10) NULL,
    [Race] nvarchar(50) NULL,
    [Gender] nvarchar(20) NULL,
    [Disability] bit NULL,
    [EELevel] nvarchar(50) NULL,
    [EECategory] nvarchar(50) NULL
);
```

**Indexes created for better query performance:**

- IX_EmployeeLookups_LastName
- IX_EmployeeLookups_Race
- IX_EmployeeLookups_Gender
- IX_EmployeeLookups_EELevel
- IX_EmployeeLookups_EECategory
- IX_EmployeeLookups_Disability

## Features

### CRUD Operations

- Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- Proper error handling and validation
- Model validation using data annotations

### Advanced Query Features

- Search functionality across multiple fields
- Filtering by various demographic categories
- Optimized queries with proper indexing

### Authentication & Authorization

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Follows existing application security patterns

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed exception logging

### API Documentation

- XML documentation comments for all controller methods
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration ready

## Usage

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require a valid JWT token
2. **Content-Type**: Use `application/json` for POST/PUT requests
3. **Personnel Number**: Used as the primary identifier for all operations
4. **Search**: Case-insensitive search across first name, last name, known name, and personnel number

## Next Steps

The EmployeeLookup service is now fully functional and ready for use. You can:

1. Test the endpoints using the provided HTTP file
2. Integrate with your frontend application
3. Add additional business logic as needed
4. Extend with additional query methods if required
